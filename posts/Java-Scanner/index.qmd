## Introduction: The Scanner Machine

By default, the variables you write in code are fixed. But what if we want to ask the user for the numbers?

Think of the **Scanner** like a physical scanner machine in an office.
Usually, when you put a paper in a physical scanner, it scans the **entire** page at once.

In Java, our Scanner is a bit different. It looks at what the user types on the keyboard, but we can be very specific about **what** to scan. We can tell it: *"Only scan the next number (int)"* or *"Only scan the next decimal point (float)."*

---

## The 3 Steps

To use the Scanner, follow these three steps.

### Step 1: The Import Line

Java hides the Scanner tool in a specific library. You need to tell Java where to find it.
Put this line at the **very top** of your file.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```

### Step 2: Turn on the Scanner

Inside your code (in the `main` section), you need to write a specific line to set up the scanner.

::: {.callout-note}

## Note

This line looks a bit complicated with keywords like `new` and `System.in`.
**For now, please just accept this line as a rule.** Copy and paste it exactly as it is.
:::

```java
// This line prepares the scanner to read from the keyboard
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
```

### Step 3: Scan the Data

Now, you command the scanner to wait for the user to type something and store it in a variable.

```java
int age = input.nextInt();
```

## Cheat Sheet: Which Command to Use?

Depending on the **Data Type** (variable) you want to fill, you must use a specific command.

| Data Type | Command | Example Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `int` | `input.nextInt()` | Whole numbers (Age, Year) |
| `long` | `input.nextLong()` | Large whole numbers (Population) |
| `float` | `input.nextFloat()` | Decimal numbers (Temperature) |
| `double` | `input.nextDouble()` | Decimal numbers (Price, GPA) |
| `boolean` | `input.nextBoolean()` | True/False answers |

## 💻 Full Code Example

Here is a complete program. It asks for a student's number and age.

```java
import java.util.Scanner; // Step 1

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
        // Step 2: Setup the Scanner 
        // (Remember: Just copy this line for now!)
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Step 3: Ask and Scan
        
        // 1. Ask for an Integer
        System.out.print("Enter your Student Number: ");
        int studentNumber = input.nextInt();

        // 2. Ask for an Integer
        System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
        int age = input.nextInt();

        // Print the results back to see if it worked
        System.out.println("--- Result ---");
        System.out.println("Student Number: " + studentNumber);
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
    }
}
```

## Summary

1.  **Import** the tool at the top: `import java.util.Scanner;`
2.  **Setup** the tool inside main: `Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);`
3.  **Scan** the specific type you need: `nextInt()` or `nextDouble()`.

Happy Coding\! 🚀
