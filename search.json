When you type a number and hit Enter, nextInt() takes the number but leaves the “Enter” key press (newline character) in the memory. The next nextLine() reads that leftover “Enter” and thinks you finished typing.\nThe Fix: Add an extra nextLine() just to consume the leftover “Enter”.\nint id = scanner.nextInt(); \n\n// Fix: Consume the leftover newline\nscanner.nextLine(); \n\nString name = scanner.nextLine(); // Now this works!"
