But what if we want to ask the user for the numbers?\nThink of the Scanner like a physical scanner machine in an office. Usually, when you put a paper in a physical scanner, it scans the entire page at once.\nIn Java, our Scanner is a bit different. It looks at what the user types on the keyboard, but we can be very specific about what to scan. We can tell it: “Only scan the next number (int)” or “Only scan the next decimal point (float).”"
